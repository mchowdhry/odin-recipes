<h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>2 free range eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp butter</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Crack 2 eggs into a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Lightly beat with a fork until the yolks and whites are combined.</li>
        <li>Heat a frying pan over a medium heat. Melt a teaspoon of butter in the pan so the base and sides are covered. When the butter starts to foam, pour in the eggs and stir immediately with a wooden spoon. Keep stirring gently as they cook to break up the egg and help it to scramble. This should take 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the egg is nearly cooked remove from the heat and stir in another teaspoon of butter. The eggs will continue to cook in the residual heat of the pan to produce a smooth and creamy finish. Serve immediately. </li>
